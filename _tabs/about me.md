## Whoami

**üñêÔ∏è Hi! I'm Yazeed Allabadi, a student at the University of Jordan. Majoring in Cyber Security, I‚Äôve been practicing both Red Teaming and Blue teaming daily since the start of my journey as a cybersecurity bachelor candidate and I‚Äôm happy with where my feet has landed to so far.**

## üí≠ About Me

***

* Since the last few years I‚Äôve been exposing myself to as much cybersecurity content to enrich my knowledge both theoretically and practically.
* I like to stay up to date with the latest technical discoveries in the world of cybersecurity including the newest **CVE‚Äôs** and attack methodologies as well as their countermeasures ‚Üí Which is why I like to spend most of my time doing rooms at **Tryhackme** and solving **Hackthebox** machines which are spectacular learning resources for me.
* So far I‚Äôve been able to pass some industry recognized certifications like [**`eJPTv2`**](https://certs.ine.com/d35b58e4-566f-495c-ba16-b202139ccfdc) , **`INE`**[**`ICCA`**](https://certs.ine.com/da7609ba-a883-4a2d-a4b7-11efea176826) (INE Certified Cloud Associate) and [**`ISC2 CC`**](https://www.credly.com/badges/a75656c5-9c50-482d-8fd5-e5adb1b86ea8/public\_url) .
  * [**`eJPTv2`**](https://certs.ine.com/d35b58e4-566f-495c-ba16-b202139ccfdc) (E-learn Junior Penetration Tester) - _Learned Red Teaming and Penetration Testing through Hands-On training lab material and exam assessment which covered the full stages of a successful penetration testing engagement._
  * [**`ICCA`**](https://certs.ine.com/da7609ba-a883-4a2d-a4b7-11efea176826) (INE Certified Cloud Associate) _- Training Material involved Cloud Foundations and basics in addition to hands-on labs on cloud environments._
  * [**`ISC2 CC`**](https://www.credly.com/badges/a75656c5-9c50-482d-8fd5-e5adb1b86ea8/public_url) (Certified in Cybersecurity) - _Training and exam process covered Risk Management , Risk Assessment in addition to Security Operations and best practices with respect to following global standards and regulations._
  * [**`HTB CDSA`**](https://www.credly.com/badges/f19fb034-4dd4-4d40-9536-661b7006c05e/public_url) - A highly comprehensive and practical certification for SOC Analysts that involves performing practical security analysis on 2 separate security incidents and uncovering detection opportunities that may not be immediately apparent from the available data or evidence alone. It also involves constructing a commercial grade documentation report that goes beyond just SOC operations and incident handling by assessing infrastructure risk, demonstrating market readiness and client focus.
    * Feel free to check my [**`CDSA Blogpost`**](https://yazeedall.me/posts/HTB_CDSA/) for more insight and the tips and tricks I followed that helped me pass this rigorous exam.
